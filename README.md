# i_am_rich

First project in the App Brewery Flutter Course

This project is my implementation of the first project in the appbrewery.co 2021 Flutter Development Course. The app is a reference to the infamouse I Am Rich App that was added and then subsequently removed from the Apple App Store in 2008.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich

The goal of this project is to introduce basic Flutter concepts to the student without introducing a lot of widgets.
